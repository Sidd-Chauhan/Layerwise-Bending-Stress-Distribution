# Layerwise Bending Stress Distribution

## Project Overview
The **Layerwise Bending Stress Distribution** project focuses on developing an advanced algorithm for the computation of bending stress profiles in layered materials. Most importantly, the algorithm enables the analysis of the distribution of stress in layers of a material under bending loads. The core features of the project are as follows.

1. **Algorithm Development**:
   An effective method to determine bending stresses at varying depths into the material.
Considering layer-specific properties, such as modulus of elasticity, thickness and yield stress.

2. **Layer-by-Layer Analysis**:
   The algorithm calculates the stress profiles on a layer-by-layer basis, thus providing a better understanding of how the variability is at different distances away from the neutral axis across the section.

3. **Determination of Yield Stress**:
   Identifying critical layers where the stresses are going near to or beyond the material's yield stress
   Considering the safety factors and constraints in a way that it does not fail.

4. **Validation and Comparison**:
   - Its correctness is ascertained, critically and systematically with previously used classical analyses on homogeneous materials,
   - The accuracy and reliability of the prediction with regard to the stress distribution can now be achieved.
This work shows the presentation of concepts and practical uses for structural engineers, material scientists, and researchers. By succeeding in understanding how and under what conditions stress behaves in a layerwise manner, we optimize the ability to prepare strong and optimized structures.
