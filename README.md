# Layerwise-Bending-Stress-Distribution
In this project, my team formulated an advanced algorithm to compute layer by-layer bending stress profiles within materials. This encompassed the determination of yield stress and its associated constraints. Rigorous validation was achieved by comparing the algorithm's outcomes with those of homogeneous materials.
